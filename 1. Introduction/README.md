# Part 1: Introduction

***

Well hello there, fellow hackers!
This part will be kept short to get you going as fast as possible.

### Prequirements

Since exploit development is a fairly large and complex topic, you'll need
to possess some knowledge beforehand, that will be required to truly understand
the concepts of everything we'll cover in the next parts:

 - Basic Linux knowledge (yeah we'll be staring at the terminal a *LOT*)
 - Basic x64 Assembly
 - C knowledge (optional, but very appreciated)
 - Basic Perl scripting is again optional but very helpful
 - Common sense and the desire to learn and break stuff

If you believe you are ready to continue, let's set up our hacker lab!

### Setting up our Linux machine

Get yourself a nice clean Linux VM (or, if you prefer, use your main machine,
I don't really care), and install the following packages:

 - `gcc` - Compiling vulnerable programs
 - `perl` - Exploits
 - `python3` - Exploits & GDB Extensions
 - `gdb` - GNU Debugger

Lastly, install [gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef). Trust me, it will make
everything easier.

### What next?

Well... we're done with setting ourselves up for some trouble, so you can
continue reading and exploit your first buffer overflow!
